# PSOC&trade; Edge MCU: DEEPCRAFT&trade; Ready Model deployment

This code example demonstrates how to integrate a Ready Model library from the DEEPCRAFT&trade; Studio on ModusToolbox&trade;. The code example includes five different models, where four models detect different sounds: 
- Baby cry detection
- Cough detection 
- Alarm detection 
- Siren detection

These models use data from pulse-density modulation (PDM) to pulse-code modulation (PCM), which is then sent to the model for detection.

The fifth model detects hand gestures using data from the XENSIV&trade; radar sensor and this is applicable only for KIT_PSE84_AI.

Pre-trained models that are ready for production, referred to as "Ready Models," can be found on the [Imagimob Ready Model Landing Page](https://www.imagimob.com/ready-models). These models, when deployed on a device, are intended specifically for testing purposes and come with a limited number of inferences.

> **Note:** This version of the code example supports only quantised models (INT8x8).

This code example has a three project structure: CM33 secure, CM33 non-secure, and CM55 projects. All three projects are programmed to the external QSPI flash and executed in Execute in Place (XIP) mode. Extended boot launches the CM33 secure project from a fixed location in the external flash, which then configures the protection settings and launches the CM33 non-secure application. Additionally, CM33 non-secure application enables CM55 CPU and launches the CM55 application.

See the [Design and implementation](docs/design_and_implementation.md) for the functional description of this code example.


## Requirements

- [ModusToolbox&trade;](https://www.infineon.com/modustoolbox) v3.6 or later (tested with v3.6)
- Board support package (BSP) minimum required version: 1.0.0
- Programming language: C
- Associated parts: All [PSOC&trade; Edge MCU](https://www.infineon.com/products/microcontroller/32-bit-psoc-arm-cortex/32-bit-psoc-edge-arm) parts


## Supported toolchains (make variable 'TOOLCHAIN')

- GNU Arm&reg; Embedded Compiler v14.2.1 (`GCC_ARM`) – Default value of `TOOLCHAIN`
- Arm&reg; Compiler v6.22 (`ARM`)
- LLVM Embedded Toolchain for Arm&reg; v19.1.5 (`LLVM_ARM`)
> **Notes:**
> - IAR is not supported by the TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers (TFLM) library.  
> - This code example fails to build in RELEASE mode with the GCC_ARM toolchain v14.2.1 as it does not recognize some of the Helium instructions of the CMSIS-DSP library. This issue is not present in the ARM&reg; Compiler for Embedded (armclang).


## Supported kits (make variable 'TARGET')

- [PSOC&trade; Edge E84 AI Kit](https://www.infineon.com/KIT_PSE84_AI) (`KIT_PSE84_AI`) – Default value of `TARGET`
- [PSOC&trade; Edge E84 Evaluation Kit](https://www.infineon.com/KIT_PSE84_EVAL) (`KIT_PSE84_EVAL_EPC2`)
- [PSOC&trade; Edge E84 Evaluation Kit](https://www.infineon.com/KIT_PSE84_EVAL) (`KIT_PSE84_EVAL_EPC4`)


## Hardware setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

Ensure the following jumper and pin configuration on board.
- BOOT SW must be in the HIGH/ON position
- J20 and J21 must be in the tristate/not connected (NC) position

> **Note:** This hardware setup is not required for KIT_PSE84_AI.


## Software setup

See the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package installation guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxInstallguide) for information about installing and configuring the tools package.

Install a terminal emulator if you do not have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://teratermproject.github.io/index-en.html)

This example requires no additional software or tools.

> **Note:** This code example currently does not work with the custom BSP name for the `KIT_PSE84_EVAL_EPC2`, `KIT_PSE84_EVAL_EPC4` and `KIT_PSE84_AI` kits. If you want to change the BSP name to a non-default value, ensure to update the custom BSP name in *Makefile* under the relevant section. The build fails if you do not update the custom BSP name

## Operation

See [Using the code example](docs/using_the_code_example.md) for instructions on creating a project, opening it in various supported IDEs, and performing tasks, such as building, programming, and debugging the application within the respective IDEs.

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector

   To select the model, update the `MODEL_SELECTION` variable in the *Makefile* of cm55.

   **Table 1. Application resources**

   Model name           |  Macro
   :--------            | :-------------
   Cough detection      | `COUGH_MODEL`
   Alarm detection      | `ALARM_MODEL`
   Baby cry detection   | `BABYCRY_MODEL`
   Siren detection      | `SIREN_MODEL`
   Gesture detection    | `GESTURE_MODEL`

> **Note 1:** Currently, gesture detection model is supported only for the PSOC&trade; Edge AI kit. 
<br>

> **Note 2:** For Gesture detection model, place the kit at a distance of approximately 60 cms away from you for the gestures to be detected correctly. 

2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud

3. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that "DEEPCRAFT Ready Model: sirens" is displayed on the UART terminal

   **Figure 1. Terminal output on program startup for siren detection**

   **Table 2. Terminal output for recognized hand gestures**

   Below table is applicable only for `KIT_PSE84_AI`.
   
   **Push gesture** | **Swipe left gesture** | **Swipe right gesture** | **Swipe up gesture** | **Swipe down gesture**

4. Play any **Siren Sound** and ensure **USER LED 1** is turning **ON** when the Siren sound is detected

Kit  |  Available Models
:-------- | :-------------
`KIT_PSE84_AI` | Cough Model, Alarm Model, Baby Cry Model, Siren Model, Gesture Model
`KIT_PSE84_EVAL_EPC2` | Cough Model, Alarm Model, Baby Cry Model, Siren Model
